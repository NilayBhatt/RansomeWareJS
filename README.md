# Foo-Cypter

In our project, we will create a Crypto-ransomware, that will be made in NodeJS. Since it is in javascript, the ransomware will be an executable, right out of the box. The ransomware will encrpt all files with a .foo extensions to protect important files, with possible AES encryption CTR format. Once all the foo files have been encypted directions made visible withing the html page to regain access (decrepyt) to the files.

The script can be delivered using an phishing email. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

node.js --version 7.9+	node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient

npm --version 2.7.1+	npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

electorn --version 1.6.5+	Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


### Installing

install the package



## Dependencies

dotenv (npm module) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables 
fs-finder (npm module) - File system finder 
fs (Native Node.js Library)- File I/O using simple wrappers around standard POSIX functions.
node-rsa (npm module) - Node.js RSA library
file-encryptor (npm module) - Encrypts files using Node's built-in Cipher class. Encryption is stream-based for low memory footprint.
child_process (Native Node.js Library) - used to spawn a shell and runs a command within that shell
secure-random-string (npm module) - generates a cryptographically secure random string with a given length
ursa-purejs (npm module) - A pure-js drop-in replacement for URSA, using node-rsa behind the scenes
