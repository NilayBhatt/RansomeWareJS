# Foo-Cypter

In our project, we will create a Crypto-ransomware, that will be made in NodeJS. Since it is in javascript, the ransomware will be an executable, right out of the box. The ransomware will encrpt all files with a .foo extensions to protect important files, with possible AES encryption CTR format. Once all the foo files have been encypted directions made visible withing the html page to regain access (decrepyt) to the files.

The script can be delivered using an phishing email.
